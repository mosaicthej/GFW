\textbf{Abstract} -- The (Great Firewall) GFW of China is a national
scale firewall created by the Chinese government for the purpose of
controlling and censoring information on the internet. The network layer
of GFW is implemented using IDS technology in filtering routers spread
around the many AS-es in China. At these filtering routers packets are
inspected using four main mechanisms: IP blocking, DNS poisoning,
Keyword filtering and stateful traffic analysis. The focus of this paper
is to examine the mechanisms in use by the GFW focusing on their
implementation in network and transportation layer, looking at flaws and
main strategies of circumventing the GFW.

\hypertarget{i.-introduction}{%
\subsection{I. Introduction}\label{i.-introduction}}

\emph{Across the \textbf{Great Wall} can reach every corner in the
world.} \cite{01_hist1986} This email message sent to Karlsruhe
University of Germany, from Beijing in September 1987, marks China's
entrance into the Internet. Ironically, as of December 2022, with 1.07
billion Internet users domestically, \cite{02_stat2022} it would be
nearly impossible to reach to anywhere on Internet without break across
the GFW, the Great Firewall of China.

The GFW comprises of intricate and multifaceted mechanisms, which ranges
over technical, societal and political aspects. Beyond being a technical
barrier, the Wall also includes legal ramifications for those attempting
to bypass it, mandatory content regulations responsibilities for
platform hosts, and a pervasive surveillance network that monitors
digital footprints, and subtly fabricating the psychological norms,
shapes thought and molds behavior of the users.

In this paper, we will talk about the technical aspects of the Wall, and
briefly discusses the main strategies of circumventing it.

\hypertarget{ii.-operation-of-the-gfw}{%
\subsection{II. Operation of the GFW}\label{ii.-operation-of-the-gfw}}

Before covering the mechanisms used by the GFW, it is worth briefly
covering how and where the packet monitoring is done to get a complete
picture of the system.

\hypertarget{structure-of-the-gfw}{%
\subsubsection{Structure of the GFW}\label{structure-of-the-gfw}}

AS-es (autonomous systems) can be divided into internal and border AS-es
where border AS-es communicate to foreign AS-es. Most of the filtering
done by the GFW is done in the border AS-es \cite{03_whereFilter} where
the request and response packets enter and leave the country, some
filtering done inside internal AS-es \cite{03_whereFilter} as well.

Majority of the filtering is done in border AS-es, as it is the main
concern on the network layer. GFW's main work for domestic traffic is
usually done in the application layer, through social engineering and
state surveillance on hosting platforms and the users, such as requiring
content censors prior to publication on all platforms, real-name
registration of the users, and potentially legal repercussions for those
who post illicit content, etc. \cite{04_digitalEco_mypaper}. We would
not cover these aspects in this paper.

Having filtering done in internal AS-es is also likely an efficiency
measure as having everything done in border AS-es could bottleneck the
network so mitigating some of the filtering into the interior AS-es can
distribute the the load more evenly.

An important note is that the GFW isn't truly a wall in literal sense,
as the paths to nodes in China might experience different levels of
filtering, and the list of conditions for a packet to be censorable
would change over time (e.g.~the term ``Tiananmen Square'' would rise in
censorship around the anniversary of the 1989 protests in May and June)
\cite{05_conceptDoppler}.

It is the case that the purpose of the GFW isn't to create an impassable
wall that prevents all foreign traffic, as it's technically infeasible
and economically destructive to do so, but more to instill fear and
self-censorship and implicitly mold the online behavior with the sense
of compliance.

Flaws and opportunities for exploitation exist for each level of
filtering, if exploiting these flaws would lead to eventual policy
change due to the increasing cost of maintaining the GFW, or the
increasing dissent from the citizens, or the increasing pressure from
the international community; The circumvention tools would be the
catalyst for the change. 07\_taxonomy

\hypertarget{how-packets-are-monitored}{%
\subsubsection{How Packets Are
Monitored}\label{how-packets-are-monitored}}

The packets in the internet traffic tracked by the GFW are monitored
mainly with routers in various AS-es that equipped with IDS technology
\cite{03_whereFilter}, which enables the routers to inspect incoming
traffic using mechanisms to be discussed in the next sections.

Great amount of effort was put in the SDN, software defined networking,
which separated the control plane and the data plane in the routers,
this enables the routers to be more flexible and adaptive to the
changing conditions of the network, and to be able to update the
filtering rules in real-time. \cite{15_SDN}

When a packet satisfies the conditions for censorship, the most common
case for the GFW is to send a TCP RST packet to both ends to terminate
the TCP connection on both sides \cite{03_whereFilter}, triggering a
denial-of-service attack prevent a pair of endpoints from communicating.
Despite this, researchers have found it is possible to \emph{ignore} the
spoofed RST packet and still receive the responses \cite{06_ignoring}.

\href{}{2.2 Example of ignoring RST packets}

Note that the wall would also have the capability to track the ip
addresses and the content of the packets, and potentially the users who
initiates the communications.

Also note that this experiment was done in 2006, and the GFW had its
behavior since then, based on our experiment in 2024, the GFW would
still send RST packets, but the most times, the rest of the content
would be dropped.

Recent standards like HTTP/2 and QUIC would also make the GFW's job
harder as the encrypted and multiplexed nature of these transport layer
protocols, the wall would use alternative strategies to track the
packets, including deep packet inspection and stateful traffic analysis.
The increased complexity increases chances of false negatives, yielding
slightly lower blocking rates. We would discuss these findings in next
sections.

\hypertarget{iii.-ip-filtering}{%
\subsection{III. IP Filtering}\label{iii.-ip-filtering}}

IP filtering is the mechanism which has least operational cost and
lowest level of granularity. \cite{07_taxonomy} If not administrated
properly, it would result in high false positive and false negative
rates. Where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{False Positive}: Legitimate traffic is blocked. This mostly
  happens to multiple sites are hosted on a shared IP address, when
  blocking one site, all other sites on the same IP would be blocked
  disregarding the content, causes unnecessary collateral damage,
  including potential impact on the economy and innovation.
\item
  \textbf{False Negative}: Site that is deemed to be blocked is not
  blocked, This mostly happens when the site is hosted on a dynamic IP
  address, or the site is hosted on a CDN.
\end{itemize}

The IP Filtering is applied as first layer of defense, such as sites
that have a fixed IP address such as google.com or US Senate.

It is also applied to be a last resort, when other mechanisms fails to
block the traffic, this is essentially the case to deal with the use of
VPNs as a circumvention tool, in combination with active probing.

\hypertarget{implementing-ip-blocking}{%
\subsubsection{Implementing IP
Blocking}\label{implementing-ip-blocking}}

IP blocking, including other filtering mechanisms, is introducing
\emph{black hole} in the network which drops the packets silently once
the ip is recognized as a blacklisted ip.

The routers would need a list of banned IP addresses, to adapt to the
dynamic nature of the internet, the list would be updated periodically,
and the routers would be able to update the list in real-time.

One implementation is have a central database with entire list of banned
IPs, and with the knowledge of complete network topology within the
country, it would distribute the entries to routers in a way that both
balances the load and ensures consistent filtering. The per-router
distribution would also rotate the list to avoid bottleneck and
synchronization issues.

TCP wrapping is a common method to implement IP blocking, where the
routers would have a list of rules to block the IP addresses, and the
rules would be updated periodically. The rules would be in shape of
files in \texttt{/etc/hosts.deny} and \texttt{/etc/hosts.allow} files,
constituting a blacklist and whitelist respectively.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{res/3.1-etc-host.jpg}
\caption{Figure 3-1: Format of rule used in /etc/host file.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{res/3.2-rule.png}
\caption{Figure 3-2: An example rule to show how an IP could be banned.}
\end{figure}

In this sample entry of \texttt{/etc/hosts.deny} file, the rule is to
block the IP address that is trying to connect to the host. The rule is
in shape of \texttt{daemon:\ client:\ options} where the daemon is the
process name or wildcard that the client is trying to connect to, the
client is the address, host name, or wildcard to represent the client
attempting to connect. \cite{12_hostman}

The rule in figure 3-2 shows the block of IP 100.100.100.100. The rule
states that all processes that the IP address tries to connect to should
be denied, making TCP connection impossible to establish. Adding this
rule to the \texttt{/etc/host.deny} file would IP block the address
100.100.100.100 within the network

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{res/3-3-cisco.png}

Triggering}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{res/3-4-cisco-source.png}
\caption{Figure 3-4: Source-based Black Hole Filtering with Remote
Triggering}
\end{figure}

On the BGP level, the routers are configured to drop the packets from
matched IP addresses, such black-holed IP addresses involves 3 steps:
\cite{13_blackhole_cisco} \cite{14_blackhole_rfc} - \textbf{Setup
(preparation)}: A trigger is a special device that is installed at the
NOC (Network Operations Center) exclusively for the purpose of
triggering a black hole. The trigger must have an BGP peering
relationship with all the edge routers, and is configured to
redistribute static routes to its BGP peers, sends the static route by
means of an BGP routing update.

The Provider Edges (PEs) must have a static route for an unused IP
address space. For example, 192.0.2.1/32 is set to Null0 (which is not
used as a deployed IP address)

Loose URPF (Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) is configured on all
external facing interfaces of PEs.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Triggering}: When an administrator adds a static route to the
  trigger, which redistributes the route by sending a BGP update to all
  its BGP peers, setting the next hop to the target destination address
  (192.0.2.1 in this case)

  Each PE receives an BGP update and sets its next hop to the source IP
  to the unused IP address space 192.0.2.1. The next hop to this address
  is set to Null0 using a static routing entry in the router
  configuration. The next hop entry in the FIB (Forwarding Information
  Base) is updated to point to Null0.

  All traffic from the source IP will fail the loose URPF check at the
  PEs and as a consequence will be dropped.
\item
  \textbf{Withdrawal}: Once the trigger is in place, all traffic from
  the source IP address will be dropped at the PEs. If it removed from
  the black list, the administrator would manually remove the static
  route from the triggering device, which sends a BGP route withdrawal
  to its BGP peers. This prompts the edge routers to remove the existing
  route for the source IP that points to 192.0.2.1 and to install a new
  route in the FIB based on the IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) RIB
  (Routing Information Base) entry. If this new route is successful,
  loose URPF will pass and traffic will be forwarded normally.
\end{itemize}

This implementation comes with 2 flavors of black hole filtering:
Destination-Based and Source-Based. Above describes a source-based
approach but the destination-based approach is similar, excepting the
criteria for black hole a packet is the destination IP address.

In a scenario of, when Alice, a university student, attempting to
querying some blacklisted terms through a search engine somewhere
outside the country. The GFW intercepts the query and may deemed that
the search engine or the user should be punished. 16\_censorPerspectives

When encountering the source-based black hole, all packets returned from
the search engine would be dropped, and Alice would not be able to
receive the search results. The search engine would not be aware of the
black hole, and would continue to send the packets, which would be
dropped at the border. Other sites hosted on the same IP address would
also be blocked.

When encountering the destination-based black hole, Alice's IP (since
she is in the university network, the BGP would not recognize Alice's IP
over the university's NAT, but take the university's IP address) would
be black holed. All packets across BGP into that university would be
dropped. All the sudden her entire dorm would not be able to connect to
most of the sites hosted outside of the country, for a while until the
administrator removes the ban. (Usually within a short period to avoid
too much collateral damage)

The later is often been regarded as a punitive measure, and shifts the
blames of entire university's network inaccessibility to Alice for
\emph{running into the wall}, and would be a warning to other students
to avoid similar behavior. The practice of \emph{collective punishiment}
is not uncommon in China since very ancient times to extend the legal
actions beyond the individual, and thus strengthen the social control.
\cite{17_earlyChina}

The blacklist strategy is more common in the GFW, although whitelist
strategy is possible and has been used in the past, such that after 2009
Urumqi riots, internet access was blocked in Xinjiang in a way that only
less than 100 local sites, such as banks and local government sites were
accessible. \cite{10_missingLink} It lasted for nearly a year,
\cite{11_xinjiang} damages to the economy, society and people's social
life were immense.

\hypertarget{flaws-in-ip-blocking}{%
\subsubsection{Flaws in IP Blocking}\label{flaws-in-ip-blocking}}

In the case of IP blocking, the flaw would lies in their false-positive
and false-negative rates, being effective and finale itself, certain
oversites would defeat its purpose.

Since the IP blocking is limited only to a specific IP address, the
earliest circumventing attempts are proxied access, this does not
necessarily mean using a VPN. Some early circumvention strategies
features using a proxy over HTTP which is generally supported by most
browsers and applications. \cite{18_GFWSpaceTime}

Also, even for a single site, it is likely to host on CDN and the IP
address would be dynamic, the GFW would have to update the list
frequently to keep the site blocked. (Or, block the entire CDN, which
the collateral damage would be substantial. As of 2023, many CDN are
affected by the GFW. \cite{19_detect})

Being the cheapest option on the list, it essentially is not scalable to
block all the sites, to keep up with the dynamic nature of the internet,
maintenance of such list would mean a large amount of human resources
and technical overhead. Let alone of the indirect economic impacts.

Tools with minimal configuration and cost would be enabled to bypass the
IP blocking, and the GFW would have to rely on other mechanisms to keep
up with the circumvention tools.

The mechanism of over-blocking can be abused by groups or individuals to
vandalize the network, such as compromising competitor's network via
weaponizing censorship infrastructure, constitutes availibility attack;
or to disrupt the network constantly that the cooperating parties would
be annoyed, increase dissent and therefore defeat the purpose of the
GFW. (Although the existence of GFW is self-defeating in the first
place)

\hypertarget{iv.-dns-manipulation}{%
\subsection{IV. DNS Manipulation}\label{iv.-dns-manipulation}}

Due to the majority of DNS request is over UDP, which tends to lack
verification and encryption, DNS request are very vulnerable to
hijacking and spoofing. \cite{20_dnsUDP}

Part of the GFW is consisted of liar DNS servers and DNS hijackers
returning incorrect IP addresses.

At these server DNS, manipulation can be done where instead of returning
the actual IP address for a result or relaying it to another DNS server,
the servers would reply with either a non-functional IP address or with
IP address of another website (e.g., leads to the site of local police
department).

Evidences suggests that the DNS filtering is keyword based
\cite{21_dnsCompreh} , this would implicitly solve the problem of mirror
url for the same content, and the DNS manipulation would be able to
block the entire domain, including all subdomains and the content hosted
on the domain.

Because those domestic DNS servers are topologically and geographically
closer to the users, the uses would be directed to the compromised
addresses before the upstream can respond to the query.

\#\#\# Implementing DNS Manipulation

Usually, DNS servers stores DNS records for recently accessed hosts in
cache. If a record is in the cache, then the server would return the
record directly as there is no need to query the record from the
authoritative server again. \cite{22_dnsConcpets} Unless the record is
expired, the server would query the upstream servers for the record of
actual IP address. Most general DNS records are in the form of A and
AAAA records, which stores IPv4 and IPv6 addresses respectively.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{res/4.1-DNS.png}
\caption{Figure 4-1: An example of A and AAAA type records}
\end{figure}

DNS poisoning happens when the cache inside a server has been modified
so that it returns the wrong IP address without validating the record
with the authoritative server. This is a common attack vector for
redirecting users to malicious sites, and the GFW uses this mechanism to
block the access to certain sites.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{res/4.2-DNS-poisoned.png}
\caption{Figure 4-2: An example of DNS cache poisoning}
\end{figure}

In example with the Figure 4-2, the DNS cache poisoning would be done by
directly implanting fake DNS records into the cache of the DNS server.
With the state-owned ISPs, DNS relay is compromised and the DNS records
are all poisoned. Existing verification means such as using TTL on the
DNS records are not effective, compares to a 3rd party DNS spoofing
attack, where an individual attacker usually have temporary access to
few servers; the affected DNS server, and all downstream and domestic
servers are state-controlled. Conventional verification is futile.
23\_dnsMeasure

\hypertarget{flaws-of-dns-manipulation}{%
\subsubsection{Flaws of DNS
Manipulation}\label{flaws-of-dns-manipulation}}

Avoiding the compromised DNS servers in first place would be the most
effective way to bypass the DNS manipulation.

For example, systems using systemd would be able to use
\texttt{systemd-resolved} to edit \texttt{/etc/systemd/resolved.conf} to
add entries that override the default DNS. This would allow the system
to use a different DNS server that is trusted. Note that due to the
recursive lookup feature, the DNS server need to ensure that all
upstream are from clean sources too.

Directly typing the IP addresses in browsers would also bypass DNS
manipulation.

Recent moves towards DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) would
also make the DNS manipulation harder, as the DNS request and response
would be encrypted and the upstream DNS server would be able to verify
the authenticity of the DNS records.

The problems still ensue as 1. The ISP can just deny providing the
service to the user who uses DoH/DoT. 2. Opportunities of sidechannel
attacks still exist to detect anomalies in the encrypted traffic.

Note that the \emph{poison} in the tampered servers infers that, those
compromises would have propagating effects due to the recursive nature
of DNS lookups. In 2012, internet groups has found out that with 39
AS-es in China injecting forged DNS replies, open resolvers outside
China distributed in 109 countries, suffer some collateral damage from
those forged replies, 3 TLDs affected almost completely (99.53\%,
domains from within GFW, expected), and 11573 resolvers affected
(26.4\%) or 1 out of 16 unexpected TLDs.

\hypertarget{v.-survey-of-circumvention-tools-and-strategies}{%
\subsection{V. Survey of Circumvention Tools and
Strategies}\label{v.-survey-of-circumvention-tools-and-strategies}}

Various circumvention tools have been developed to bypass the GFW,
gradually increasing in complexity, with trade-offs among dimensions of:
\cite{07_taxonomy}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Availability}: there is no use of an anti-censorship technology
  if the target users cannot acces it.
\item
  \emph{User-friendliness}: an often under-explored dimension, given the
  large population of users who are not technology-savvy.
\item
  \emph{Verifiability}: how can a user verify that the software is not a
  monitoring tool from the government.
\item
  \emph{Scope}: how many modes of communication can be covered.
\item
  \emph{Security}: this is the most obvious dimension of an anti-censor.
\item
  \emph{Deniability}: if caught, how can a user deny her involvement.
\item
  \emph{Performance}: how much will throughput and delay be degraded by
  using the anti-censor.
\end{enumerate}

Those aspects often has trade-offs against each other, e.g.,
scope-deniability vs performance-availablity,
userfriendliness-denialibilty.

Just like the censorship system, the anti-censorship tools also comes in
multiple components targeting different layers of the network stack that
works together to bypass the censored network, most times corresponding
to a specific censorship mechanism. e.g., secured alternative messaging
application to ones raised security concerns (e.g., Signal, Telegram,
etc), alternative DNS server for DNS manipulation, VPN or HTTP proxy for
IP blocking, and encrypted tunnel for DPI and obfuscation for stateful
traffic analysis. \cite{48_globalDefeat}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./res/5.1-anatomy.png}
\caption{Figure 5-1: Anatomy of anti-censorship system}
\end{figure}

Note that supporting the circumvention tools might involve out-of-band
communication channels such as hidden part of CD/DVD, floppy disks, USB
drives, or QR codes, URL and barcodes as printed materials, also
includes word-of-mouth.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./res/5.2-adoption.png}
\caption{Figure 5-2: An interactive communication technology adoption
channel}
\end{figure}

As figure 5-2 \cite{49_ICTAdopt} addressed the people's adoption of most
ICTs, it is consisted on the spectrum from micro-individual to
macro-social poles: with factors in aspects of \emph{system, technology,
audience, social, use, adoption}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./res/5.3-circumventAdopt.png}
\caption{Figure 5-3: A roadmap for understanding the use of
circumvention tools}
\end{figure}

Similar pattern (figure 5-3) \cite{47_circumvention} would apply to
circumvention tool use, with more weights on how each other factors
would affect the usage, then usage would also have a reciprocal effect
on the other factors.

Noting that each of those factors are important in their own right, the
scope of rest of this paper would focus on the technical aspects of the
circumvention tools, and how they interact with the GFW.

There are three commonly used circumvention methods that works together
to bypass the GFW: \cite{07_taxonomy} - HTTP/CGI proxy - VPN (IP
tunneling) - Re-routing - Distributed Hosting

\hypertarget{httpcgi-proxy}{%
\subsubsection{HTTP/CGI Proxy}\label{httpcgi-proxy}}

HTTP proxying sends HTTP requests through an intermediate proxying
server, the client would send exact same HTTP request to the proxy as if
it is send to the target server. The proxy server may re-parse the HTTP
request, and sends its own HTTP request to the target server, then
returns the response back to the proxy client.

CGI proxy, on the other hand, is a bit obfuscated, it uses a server-side
script to perform proxying function. A CGI proxy client sends the
requested URL as payload embedded in the data portion of an HTTP request
to CGI server.

The CGI server then pull out the intended target information from the
payload, and sends the request to the target server, then returns the
response back to the CGI client.

Those are seen more primarily in the older systems, such as
\emph{Freenet} (1999), \emph{UltraSurf} (2002), \emph{DynaWeb} (2002),
which mainly uses HTTP proxy, and \emph{Psiphon} (2006) which uses CGI
proxy.

Each has its own issues such as limitations and dependencies on the
client software, and it was designed when GFW was at its infancy, later
added features (such as addition of DNS hijacking) would render these
tools ineffective.

The ideas of HTTP/CGI still leaves a legacy in more modern circumvention
tools.

\hypertarget{re-routing-and-distributed-hosting}{%
\subsubsection{Re-routing and Distributed
Hosting}\label{re-routing-and-distributed-hosting}}

Re-routing systems route data through a \textbf{series} of proxying
servers, encrypting the data again at each proxy, so that a given proxy
knows at most either where the traffic came from or where it is going
to, but not both.

\emph{Tor} (2002) is the most famous and long-lived re-routing system,
which routes the data through a series of volunteer-run nodes.

However, \emph{Tor} is not a accessible in China since around 2015, it
is lately known that TOR's obfuscation leaves a fingerprint that is
possible to be detected. (e.g., fixed packet size, fixed packet
interval, etc) Even it is hard to decipher the content of the packets,
the fact that it is a TOR packet is enough for such traffic to be
blocked. \cite{50_tor_finger} The SDN topology of the GFW has separate
nodes that is each specialized at high-efficency relaying and traffic
analysis. Similar to the remotely triggered black hole model, the
analysing node triggers the blocking node to block the TOR traffic.

Usability and QoS issues also makes the TOR less attractive to the
general public, combined with social engineering and legal repercussions
as deterrents, users are less likely to participate in the TOR network.

On the other hand, the GFW is scaling up by with increasing control and
higher computation power, with the decreasing number of participants in
P2P networks, it is not surprising that the peers in such networks are
likely to be state-controlled.

Distributed hosting is more of a server effort than client effort, and
usually for the purpose of mitigating DDoS and single-point-of-failure
issues. It is effective against ip blocking.

However, depending on the CDN, there are cases that entire CDN is
blocked by the GFW, such as github was not blocked but had connection
issues in China, as its CDN, \emph{Fastly}, was blocked.
\cite{19_detect}

At another case, CDNs might chose to practice geo-block due to
economical pressures. In 2018 researchers found that many CDNs had
server-side blocking with China, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, Russia and
North Korea. \cite{51_CDN403}

\hypertarget{tunneling}{%
\subsubsection{Tunneling}\label{tunneling}}

As of today, the most common circumvention tool is use of a VPN
tunneling with self-hosted VPS or commercial shared VPN services.

The user usually purchases a (virtual) machine in a place without
censorship that can be accessed remotely, and installs tunneling
software (e.g., openSSH, etc.) on the machine.

For each session where the user needs to access uncensored content, the
user would establish a SSH connection to the machine, and set up a SOCKS
proxy on the client side, then redirect partial or all of the traffic
through the tunnel to their VPS, then the VPS would relay the request
and response between the client and the target server as a bridge.

It is by far the most effective and secure way to bypass the GFW, since
the VPS tends to be privately owned, and the traffic is encrypted
end-to-end. Taking down one VPS would only affect the users on that VPS,
but it is relatively cheap to switch to another VPS, compares to the
increasing overhead of the GFW to block all the VPS-es.

The only known way for the GFW to confronting it is to perform deep
packet inspection and traffic analysis that recognizes the traffic
pattern within the tunnel, and block the source IP address of the VPS.
(we are excluding the social-engineering and legal repercussions in this
paper)

\textbf{Shadowsocks} (2012) is an open-sourced SOCKS protocols framework
that is popular in China. It has many open-source forks in various
languages \cite{36_SS-py} \cite{37_SS-rust} 38\_SS-go 39\_SS-cs.\\
According to a research survey in July 2015, of 371 faculty members and
students from Tsinghua Univer-sity, 21\% used Shadowsocks to bypass
censorship in China. \cite{50_googleScholar}

The popularity of Shadowsocks stems from its simplicity. Its lightweight
design imposes minimal overhead on proxied traffic and makes it easy to
implement on a variety of platforms. A large, profit-incentivized proxy
reseller market, as well as numerous tutorials and one-click
installation scripts, have reduced the difficulty of installing and
using Shadowsocks, and made it popular even among non-technical users.

Researchers found that the GFW utilizes an \emph{active probing}
mechanism to detect the Shadowsocks traffic, and then block the source
IP addresses of the VPS-es. \cite{40_SSProbe} Still, the blocks are only
anecdotally reported, and continuing development of Shadowsocks to
improve its encryption and obfuscation with community efforts.

\hypertarget{novel-protocols}{%
\subsubsection{Novel Protocols}\label{novel-protocols}}

Recent developments and adoption of novel protocols such as QUIC, HTTP/3
and IPv6 would also make the GFW's job harder, as the multiplexed and
encrypted nature in the transport and network layer make it harder to
track traffic states, also increases the problem space exponentially for
rule-based filtering.

\hypertarget{quichttp3}{%
\paragraph{QUIC+HTTP/3}\label{quichttp3}}

\textbf{QUIC} (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a transport layer
protocol was designed to provide secure, consistent, and low-latency
connections over the internet. A secure connection resembling DTLS
(Datagram Transport Layer Security) is running atop UDP and multiplexes
multiple streams over the same connection.
\textless x\textless\textgreater{}@54\_QUIC

\textbf{HTTP/3} is the 3rd major version of HTTP used to exchange
information on the WWW. HTTP/3 is based on QUIC, and is designed to
improve the performance of the web, especially for mobile devices.
\cite{55_HTTP3}

The introduction of HTTP/3 (HTTP over QUIC) yields promising
expectations to counteract such interference, due to its novelty,
build-in encryption, and faster connection establishment. QUIC's methods
of IP address discovery should also make it harder to spoof.

Researchers in 2020 conducted a study on the effectiveness of the GFW to
block QUIC traffic, found that for AS-es which has high failure rate on
TCP connections (TCP-handshake timeout and connection reset), yields a
significantly lower failure rate on QUIC connections.
\cite{53_quicBlock}

The same research also suggests that IP blocking is the primary
causation of the failing QUIC connections. Since the censor does not
exclusively apply IP endpoint blocking, hosts that are targeted by a
different form of HTTPS censorship are still available over QUIC.

The adaptation of IPv6 would also make the GFW's job harder, as the IPv6
address space is significantly larger than IPv4, and the GFW would have
higher operational overhead to keep adding more entries in the
blacklist, and also meant easier allocation for individual users to have
their more VPSs in the IPv6 space.

\hypertarget{vi.-keyword-filtering-deep-packet-inspection-stateful-traffic-analysis-and-evolution-of-gfw}{%
\subsection{VI. Keyword Filtering, Deep Packet Inspection Stateful
Traffic Analysis and Evolution of
GFW}\label{vi.-keyword-filtering-deep-packet-inspection-stateful-traffic-analysis-and-evolution-of-gfw}}

Where conventional blocking criteria are based on protocol's header
information, GFW evolves to use novel methods that inspect and analysis
the payloads as well.

When deemed that the cost of false negative for oversighting of
information is more emergent issue than potential loss of false
positives, but more are the cases that different parties of a
authoritarian government fails to coordinate with each other. Such as
Iran blocks all UDP traffic. \cite{53_quicBlock}

Various advanced methods are applied with the SDN topology of the GFW,
which separates the concerns for high-efficiency relaying blocking
(packet drop) nodes (data panel), and mirrors the traffic to real-time
traffic analysis nodes (control panel), those nodes then signal
instructions to the data nodes to block the traffic or not.

However, various traffic analysis is only been found in the case where a
node relays the traffic

\hypertarget{fingerprinting}{%
\subsubsection{Fingerprinting}\label{fingerprinting}}

For some encrypted and obfuscated traffic, such as TOR, even the payload
are not easily readable, the traffic would still have side-channel
vulnerabilities, such as the fixed packet size, fixed packet interval,
and entropy of the packets. \cite{50_tor_finger} \cite{56_gfwTOR}
\cite{57_blockingTor}

In particular, Tor (in 2012), has a TLS client \texttt{hello} in the Tor
cipher list, with the purpose of initiate a TLS connection.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{c0 0a c0 14 00 39 00 38 c0 0f c0 05 00 35 c0 07}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Listing 1.1.} Tor cipher list inside TLS client hello.

It is one of the few unique features of Tor traffic that can be used to
fingerprint the traffic, and the GFW uses this feature to locate Tor
traffic.

Fingerprinting is also the mechanisms where the routers recognizes
anomalies in the traffic pattern, \cite{26_gfwSS2020} once this is
detected, probes will be send to server or the client for further attack
gaining more data to confirm the anomaly, and then block the traffic.
(usually done in a \textbf{replay attack})

\hypertarget{active-probing-and-evolutions}{%
\subsubsection{Active Probing and
evolutions}\label{active-probing-and-evolutions}}

In case of Shadowsocks, the GFW uses an active probing mechanism to
detect the Shadowsocks traffic, and then block the source IP addresses
of the VPS-es.

The study in 2020 set up sets up series of experiments which attracts
the active probs from GFW. They studied the behaviors and fingerprinted
certain traits of probes sent by GFW, including IP origin, AS origin,
and TTL values.

Compares to similar study done in 2015 \cite{46_gfw-discover}, there are
few more traits that indicates the wall became stronger during the 5
years, in terms of the active prober, which it is less likely to be
recognized as a probe, and more likely to be recognized as a normal
request.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

\textbf{51837 probes with 12300 addresses} \\
\textbf{replays} & \textbf{Little variation} & \textbf{systematic
variation} \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Noticibly, the two source IP has a very small overlap (167 out of 3500),
suggesting possible more dense probing nodes, or the GFW is gradually
increasing the number of probing nodes.

Also, in terms of \textbf{replay attacks}, where nearly no variation is
found in the 2015 study, the 2020 study found a systematic variation in
the replay attacks, in ways that changing certain bits as a trait group
for OutlineVPN and other set of change for ShadowSocks and for Tor.
Also, there is a noticeable \textbf{state- transition} in which types of
the replay attacks are used.

The study also found that \textbf{packet length} as a fingerprinting
trait to identify ShadowSocks and other tunneling traffic, as well that
a high-entropy payload is more likely to gain attention, as a packets
with a per-byte entropy of 7.2 is 4 times more likely to be probed
compared to a packet with entropy of 3.0.

By analyzing the behavior before and after an VPS is blocked by the
wall, there is a theory of machine-scanned registry of the VPS
black-list (gray?) and human-administrated block-lists, and unblockings.

An adversary model is proposed:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  GFW passively recognizes certain traffic pattern are likely to be
  circumvention tools,
\item
  Probes are sent to the suspected VPS for confirmation, primiarly uses
  the Replay.
\item
  The VPS are likely to be marked on \emph{Black/Gray List}, and faced
  blocking by adminstrators at any future time.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{social-engineering}{%
\subsubsection{Social Engineering}\label{social-engineering}}

While in the attempt of demystifying the GFW, we might be
underestimating or overestimating the technical capabilities of GFW, it
is entirely feasible that the deep-learning based traffic analysis is
just a rumor, as the GFW tends to rely on the state-controlled violence
and social engineering to achieve the same goal.

Around the same time where the developer and maintainer posted the
possible solutions to redirect the replay attacks to other http sites,
and improving the cipher being used, and ready to deploy the new version
of the Shadowsocks, the state police found the maintainer and the repo
was \emph{voluntarily} deleted by the maintainer,
\emph{clowwindy@GitHub}. \cite{58_breakwaIssue}

Again, as many would argue, the GFW is not a technical problem, but a
social problem, and the social engineering is the most effective way to
defeat the GFW, as the GFW is not a monolithic entity, but a collection
of individuals with different goals and motivations.

The censorship tools inspect DNS queries near the ISP\textquotesingle{}s boundary routers for sensitive domain keywords and inject forged DNS responses, blocking the users from accessing censored sites, such as twitter and facebook. Unfortunately this causes collateral damage, affecting communication beyond the censored networks when outside DNS traffic traverses censored links. In this paper, we analyze the causes of the collateral damages and measure the Internet to identify the injecting activities and their effect. We find 39 ASes in China injecting forged DNS replies. Furthermore, 26 of 43,000 measured open resolvers outside China, distributed in 109 countries, may suffer some collateral damage from these forged replies. Different from previous work that considers the collateral damage being limited to queries to root servers (F, I, J) located in China, we find that most collateral damage arises when the paths between resolvers and some TLD name servers transit through ISPs in China.\},}

  \DataTypeTok{abstract}\NormalTok{ = \{Shadowsocks is one of the most popular circumvention tools in China. Since May 2019, there have been numerous anecdotal reports of the blocking of Shadowsocks from Chinese users. In this study, we reveal how the Great Firewall of China (GFW) detects and blocks Shadowsocks and its variants. Using measurement experiments, we find that the GFW uses the length and entropy of the first data packet in each connection to identify probable Shadowsocks traffic, then sends seven different types of active probes, in different stages, to the corresponding servers to test whether its guess is correct.We developed a prober simulator to analyze the effect of different types of probes on various Shadowsocks implementations, and used it to infer what vulnerabilities are exploited by the censor. We fingerprinted the probers and found differences relative to previous work on active probing. A network{-}level side channel reveals that the probers, which use thousands of IP addresses, are likely controlled by a set of centralized structures.Based on our gained understanding, we present a temporary workaround that successfully mitigates the traffic analysis attack by the GFW. We further discuss essential strategies to defend against active probing. We responsibly disclosed our findings and suggestions to Shadowsocks developers, which has led to more censorship{-}resistant tools.\},}

  \DataTypeTok{abstract}\NormalTok{ = \{ Circumvention tools designed to bypass online censorship—such as simple web proxies, virtual private network service, and so on—are frequently used in countries whose governments impose heavy Internet censorship. Around 18 million Internet users in China are currently using those tools to bypass the Great Firewall and access unblocked online content. In a pioneering empirical investigation of unblocked information seeking in China’s censored online environment, the present study systematically examines a wide range of macro{-}social and micro{-}individual factors which affect the use of circumvention tools to bypass Internet censorship under the guidance of the interactive communication technology adoption model. The results reveal that, with the exception of social trust, macro{-}social factors have only a modest influence on the use of circumvention tools. In contrast, micro{-}individual{-}level variables—including perceived technology fluidity, gratifications, and selected demographic variables—play a much larger role in our multivariate model. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. \}}

  \DataTypeTok{abstract}\NormalTok{ = \{In the evolving research arena of mediated communication technology adoption and uses, one of the most valuable developments involves the increased integration of distinct communication research traditions. This emerging fusion presents an unprecedented opportunity for communication researchers to share, confer, and challenge the “native” tradition that each has followed. This article proposes an integrated research model and explains how it can serve as the basis for mediated communication technology adoption research. In particular, this proposed model is intended to provide a research framework for studying the factors that help shape adoption decisions of various communication technologies and the potential impact of technology adoption on the social system, audiences, and use patterns.\},}

  \DataTypeTok{abstract}\NormalTok{ = \{Tor is one of the most popular anonymity networks that allows Internet users to hide their browsing activity. Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users\textquotesingle{} privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages\textquotesingle{} information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in{-}depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed{-}world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor\textquotesingle{}s practicality in real{-}world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques\textquotesingle{} actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research\textquotesingle{}s limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies\textquotesingle{} contribution category and development phase.\}}

  \DataTypeTok{abstract}\NormalTok{ = \{We report the first wide{-}scale measurement study of server{-}side geographic restriction, or geoblocking, a phenomenon in which server operators intentionally deny access to users from particular countries or regions. Many sites practice geoblocking due to legal requirements or other business reasons, but excessive blocking can needlessly deny valuable content and services to entire national populations.To help researchers and policymakers understand this phenomenon, we develop a semi{-}automated system to detect instances where whole websites were rendered inaccessible due to geoblocking. By focusing on detecting geoblocking capabilities offered by large CDNs and cloud providers, we can reliably distinguish the practice from dynamic anti{-}abuse mechanisms and network{-}based censorship. We apply our techniques to test for geoblocking across the Alexa Top 10K sites from thousands of vantage points in 177 countries. We then expand our measurement to a sample of CDN customers in the Alexa Top 1M.We find that geoblocking occurs across a broad set of countries and sites. We observe geoblocking in nearly all countries we study, with Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, and Russia experiencing the highest rates. These countries experience particularly high rates of geoblocking for finance and banking sites, likely as a result of U.S. economic sanctions. We also verify our measurements with data provided by Cloudflare, and find our observations to be accurate.\},}

  \DataTypeTok{abstract}\NormalTok{ = \{Web traffic censorship limits the free access to information, making it a global human rights issue. The introduction of HTTP/3 (HTTP over QUIC) yields promising expectations to counteract such interference, due to its novelty, build{-}in encryption, and faster connection establishment. To evaluate this hypothesis and analyze the current state of HTTP/3 blocking, we extended the open{-}source censorship measurement{-}tool OONI with an HTTP/3 module. Using an input list of possibly{-}blocked websites, real{-}world measurements with HTTPS and HTTP/3 were conducted in selected Autonomous Systems in China, Iran, India, and Kazakhstan. The presented evaluation assesses the different blocking methodologies employed for TCP/TLS versus the ones employed for QUIC. The results reveal dedicated UDP blocking in Iran and major IP blocklisting affecting QUIC in China and India.\},}
