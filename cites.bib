In this work, we explore the AS-level topology of China's network, and probe the firewall to find the locations of filtering devices. We find that even though most filtering occurs in border ASes, choke points also exist in many provincial networks. The result suggests that two major ISPs in China have different approaches placing filtering devices.",

  abstract = {Abstract With the advent of cloud computing, many new networking concepts have been introduced to simplify network management and bring innovation through network programmability. The emergence of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is one of these adopted concepts in the cloud model so as to eliminate the network infrastructure maintenance processes and guarantee easy management. In this fashion, SDN offers real-time performance and responds to high availability requirements. However, this new emerging paradigm has been facing many technological hurdles; some of them are inherent, while others are inherited from existing adopted technologies. In this paper, our purpose is to shed light on SDN related issues and give insight into the challenges facing the future of this revolutionary network model, from both protocol and architecture perspectives. Additionally, we aim to present different existing solutions and mitigation techniques that address SDN scalability, elasticity, dependability, reliability, high availability, resiliency, security, and performance concerns.

  abstract = {Some ISPs and governments (most notably the Great Firewall of China) use DNS injection to block access to "unwanted" websites. The censorship tools inspect DNS queries near the ISP's boundary routers for sensitive domain keywords and inject forged DNS responses, blocking the users from accessing censored sites, such as twitter and facebook. Unfortunately this causes collateral damage, affecting communication beyond the censored networks when outside DNS traffic traverses censored links. In this paper, we analyze the causes of the collateral damages and measure the Internet to identify the injecting activities and their effect. We find 39 ASes in China injecting forged DNS replies. Furthermore, 26 of 43,000 measured open resolvers outside China, distributed in 109 countries, may suffer some collateral damage from these forged replies. Different from previous work that considers the collateral damage being limited to queries to root servers (F, I, J) located in China, we find that most collateral damage arises when the paths between resolvers and some TLD name servers transit through ISPs in China.},

  abstract = {Shadowsocks is one of the most popular circumvention tools in China. Since May 2019, there have been numerous anecdotal reports of the blocking of Shadowsocks from Chinese users. In this study, we reveal how the Great Firewall of China (GFW) detects and blocks Shadowsocks and its variants. Using measurement experiments, we find that the GFW uses the length and entropy of the first data packet in each connection to identify probable Shadowsocks traffic, then sends seven different types of active probes, in different stages, to the corresponding servers to test whether its guess is correct.We developed a prober simulator to analyze the effect of different types of probes on various Shadowsocks implementations, and used it to infer what vulnerabilities are exploited by the censor. We fingerprinted the probers and found differences relative to previous work on active probing. A network-level side channel reveals that the probers, which use thousands of IP addresses, are likely controlled by a set of centralized structures.Based on our gained understanding, we present a temporary workaround that successfully mitigates the traffic analysis attack by the GFW. We further discuss essential strategies to defend against active probing. We responsibly disclosed our findings and suggestions to Shadowsocks developers, which has led to more censorship-resistant tools.},

  abstract = { Circumvention tools designed to bypass online censorshipâsuch as simple web proxies, virtual private network service, and so onâare frequently used in countries whose governments impose heavy Internet censorship. Around 18âmillion Internet users in China are currently using those tools to bypass the Great Firewall and access unblocked online content. In a pioneering empirical investigation of unblocked information seeking in Chinaâs censored online environment, the present study systematically examines a wide range of macro-social and micro-individual factors which affect the use of circumvention tools to bypass Internet censorship under the guidance of the interactive communication technology adoption model. The results reveal that, with the exception of social trust, macro-social factors have only a modest influence on the use of circumvention tools. In contrast, micro-individual-level variablesâincluding perceived technology fluidity, gratifications, and selected demographic variablesâplay a much larger role in our multivariate model. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. }

  abstract = {In the evolving research arena of mediated communication technology adoption and uses, one of the most valuable developments involves the increased integration of distinct communication research traditions. This emerging fusion presents an unprecedented opportunity for communication researchers to share, confer, and challenge the ânativeâ tradition that each has followed. This article proposes an integrated research model and explains how it can serve as the basis for mediated communication technology adoption research. In particular, this proposed model is intended to provide a research framework for studying the factors that help shape adoption decisions of various communication technologies and the potential impact of technology adoption on the social system, audiences, and use patterns.},

  abstract = {Tor is one of the most popular anonymity networks that allows Internet users to hide their browsing activity. Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users' privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages' information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques' actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research's limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies' contribution category and development phase.}

  abstract = {We report the first wide-scale measurement study of server-side geographic restriction, or geoblocking, a phenomenon in which server operators intentionally deny access to users from particular countries or regions. Many sites practice geoblocking due to legal requirements or other business reasons, but excessive blocking can needlessly deny valuable content and services to entire national populations.To help researchers and policymakers understand this phenomenon, we develop a semi-automated system to detect instances where whole websites were rendered inaccessible due to geoblocking. By focusing on detecting geoblocking capabilities offered by large CDNs and cloud providers, we can reliably distinguish the practice from dynamic anti-abuse mechanisms and network-based censorship. We apply our techniques to test for geoblocking across the Alexa Top 10K sites from thousands of vantage points in 177 countries. We then expand our measurement to a sample of CDN customers in the Alexa Top 1M.We find that geoblocking occurs across a broad set of countries and sites. We observe geoblocking in nearly all countries we study, with Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, and Russia experiencing the highest rates. These countries experience particularly high rates of geoblocking for finance and banking sites, likely as a result of U.S. economic sanctions. We also verify our measurements with data provided by Cloudflare, and find our observations to be accurate.},

  abstract = {Web traffic censorship limits the free access to information, making it a global human rights issue. The introduction of HTTP/3 (HTTP over QUIC) yields promising expectations to counteract such interference, due to its novelty, build-in encryption, and faster connection establishment. To evaluate this hypothesis and analyze the current state of HTTP/3 blocking, we extended the open-source censorship measurement-tool OONI with an HTTP/3 module. Using an input list of possibly-blocked websites, real-world measurements with HTTPS and HTTP/3 were conducted in selected Autonomous Systems in China, Iran, India, and Kazakhstan. The presented evaluation assesses the different blocking methodologies employed for TCP/TLS versus the ones employed for QUIC. The results reveal dedicated UDP blocking in Iran and major IP blocklisting affecting QUIC in China and India.},

QUIC has been globally deployed at Google on thousands of servers and is used to serve traffic to a range of clients including a widely-used web browser (Chrome) and a popular mobile video streaming app (YouTube). We estimate that 7\% of Internet traffic is now QUIC. We describe our motivations for developing a new transport, the principles that guided our design, the Internet-scale process that we used to perform iterative experiments on QUIC, performance improvements seen by our various services, and our experience deploying QUIC globally. We also share lessons about transport design and the Internet ecosystem that we learned from our deployment.},
